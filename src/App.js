                            It was originally inspired by <small>Craig Reynold's Boids algorithm</small>, but I made
                            it my own by adding a few features.
                            <br />
                            &#8195;I render cubes in a 3D space, and then apply a few rules to them. The cubes
                            are attracted to the mouse, and repelled from each other. Each cube has a velocity,
                            and the velocity is updated based on the rules through <span>linear interpolation</span>.
                            <br />
                            &#8195;When you click on the mouse, a velocity facing opposite to the mouse from the cube
                            is applied to each cube. Keep scrolling for some empty space to see it in action.
